# HBN_EMA_NIMH
A test repo for HBN EMA applet with NIMH content.
 
<br>

There are three applets in this repo:

### 1. master branch applet

+ This applet was converted using data_dic_noTR.csv. All single time selection questions were replaced with dropdowns
+ This applet has the ideal conditional logic in the activity_schema files
+ However, this causes a few activities to not display at all: morning_sleep_and_behavior, intake, headache

<br>
